# Robotic Legs actuated by Pneumatic Artificial Muscles and Reinforcement Learning implementation to train them to walk

## Master Thesis
This project joins the work realised during my two Master Thesis. Here you can find both reports:
* **Master Thesis in Industrial Engieering**: [Model design of a lower body humanoid robot based on PAM actuators and reinforcement learning implementation for its control](https://oa.upm.es/65525/1/TFM_EDUARDO_REYERO_IBANEZ.pdf)
* **Master Thesis in Artificial Intelligence**:
