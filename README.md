# Robotic Legs actuated by Pneumatic Artificial Muscles and Reinforcement Learning implementation to train them to walk

## Master Thesis
This project joins the work carried out during my two Master Thesis. Here you can find both reports:
* **Master Thesis in Industrial Engieering**: [Model design of a lower body humanoid robot based on PAM actuators and reinforcement learning implementation for its control](https://oa.upm.es/65525/1/TFM_EDUARDO_REYERO_IBANEZ.pdf)
* **Master Thesis in Artificial Intelligence**: [Deep reinforcement learning algorithms comparison in their application to a lower body humanoid robot model based on pneumatic artificial muscle actuators](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OpMo1SvGTNUHVWxP6zRofi0JJWP4zGPk/view?usp=sharing) (This one is written in spanish, although it has an english version article summing up all the report at the end)
